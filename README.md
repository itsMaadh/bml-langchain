# Bank of Maldives Langchain Bot

This script uses langchain to create a conversational retreival chain. It uses the [FAQ Page of Bank of Maldives website](https://www.bankofmaldives.com/faqs) to answer the prompted questions. As of right now, this outperforms the [Aaya Bot](https://www.bankofmaldives.com/chatwithaaya) BML uses on their website.
